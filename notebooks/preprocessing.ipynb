When we realized that we simply couldn't find it anywhere in our city we were bummed.<br /><br />Now, because of the magic of the internet, we have a case of the sauce and are ecstatic because of it.<br /><br />If you love hot sauce..I mean really love hot sauce, but don't want a sauce that tastelessly burns your throat, grab a bottle of Tequila Picante Gourmet de Inclan.

         "McCann's makes oatmeal for every oatmeal connoisseur, whether one likes it from the raw pellet state that cooks for half an hour, to the sloth addled instant, which can be done in the microwave for under three minutes. It's all good, that's for sure, and the beauty of the instant variety is that it is available in different flavors as well as regular.<br />  This variety pack allows different tastes to be explored, as well as giving you a chance to experience the difference between McCann's and other well-known oatmeals. What I personally like about McCann's is that it cooks up thicker and with more body than the top brand here in America. The Apples & Cinnamon, though, tends to be a little liquidy so you may want to experiment with the amount of water you add. In my 1300watt microwave the oatmeal cooks up in about one minute and twenty-seven seconds, so you should also watch that to get a handle on how much time and water to use.<br />  The only bad thing -- if you can consider it a bad thing -- about this offering is that you have to buy in lot so you'll end up with six ten-count boxes. This is good if you have a whole family of oatmeal-eaters, but if you're a single person alone -- well, love oatmeal."

Long desert rides on the dirt bike always found my camelbak water heavily laced with the endurolyte powder, not overly tasty, but quite effective, as I never got a cramp on these several hundred mile rides.  Same for desert racing in the buggy, the camelbaks were always laced with the powder.  Now we have the Fizz...what a great product!  Firstly, its Hammer's endurolyte product so it's great, endurance athlete's the world over use their products. Second its convenient, handly tablets that dissovle in a fizz.  Third it tastes great! Imagine getting a nice cool drink when your body is starving for hydration and electrolytes and rather than getting a \"salty\" taste, you get a refreshing lemon-lime or mango!  The camelbaks always get the Fizz now.  I also drop a tablet in my bottled water whenever I exercise and have a nice flavored water chock full of electrolytes. I cannot recommend this product or any hammer product highly enough."

I was drinking plain water but did a little research and thought electrolytes might be the issue.  Gatorade wasn't an option because it is so loaded with carbohydrates so I looked around for a low-carb alternative.  The \"zero carb\" sports drinks didn't help so what to do?  One day I ran across these at my bike shop so tried a tube of them.....voila!...problem solved!!<br /><br />I've shared them with two friends in particular whose problems with leg cramps were resolved while using these.<br /><br />These guys got it right -- they are superbly formulated and simply work....."

So I bought 10lbs... : ) These bears are a little bit bigger then the other brands and have kind of sour kick, but nothing to strong. I love grape flavored candy/soda and these are pretty good. There is another company that makes grape gummy bears that are a little bit better in my opinion, but these are well worth it for the price. I like to use the gummy bears in home made Popsicles with flavored sports drink. The salt in the sports drink makes for softer popsicles, and the gummy bears are awesome frozen. They are delicious!"

I know that sounds so so silly - but I enjoy cooking more when I feel like I'm using quality ingredients, and I do sometimes (perhaps mistakenly) associate good packaging with quality.<br /><br />The price here is less expensive than what I could find in a store.  The 3 pack was great because I gave 1 away as a gift in a basket along with a few other asian themed cooking items.<br /><br />Packaging was great - bubble wrapped for shipping, but not insanely difficult to unwrap.  I'd buy again, but I imagine the 2 bottles I kept for myself will last me a while."

A few ways to use five spice powder is, simply, sprinkle it on jasmine rice or Thai rice noodles, put in a favorite sweet potatoe dish and/or add to stir frys. It adds tasty, balancing flavors to any dish. I rely on Frontier for quality fresh spices and they did well with their Chinese Five Spice Powder."

Buts it's a complete mystery to me where the essence of chocolate is lurking. Moreover, there isn't a chocolate chip in sight; I pulled the bar apart and examined it carefully. Granted, the bar has a darker shade of color than the other ones of the brand I've tried, so that at least implies chocolate is present. And, there's a faint nuance of some other flavor underlying the taste of oats, but, if anything, it's suggestive of molasses.<br /><br />Mind you, I truly like these bars for the reasons previously stated. And I'll be sure to enjoy the remaining eleven of the dozen \"chocolate\" ones I purchased. But, as near as I can determine to date with the three types I've eaten, to claim there's any flavor present other than that of oats is a complete fiction and I've had to resist the impulse to award three stars or less for blatantly false advertising."

My sister and I love these King Size Baby Ruth bars because each of us gets a BIG bar and is not tempted to consume BOTH!
